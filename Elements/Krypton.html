                  <h2> Name, symbol, and atomic number</h2>
                  <p> The element on the <strong>periodic table</strong> that im going to be talking about is called <strong>krypton</strong>. <strong>Krypton</strong> comes from a greek word <em>"kryptos"</em> which mean the "hidden one" . <strong>Krypton</strong> is a noble gas, its <em>atomic number</em> is <strong>36</strong>, <em>symbol</em> is <strong>Kr</strong> and its <em>atomic weight</em> is <strong>83.798</strong> as you can see in the picture below.</p>

                 <h2>Properties</h2>
                 <p> <strong>krypton</strong> is a gas and a nonmetal substance which is colourless, scentless, tasteless ,and can't physicaly touch. Its boiling point is 153.22 degrees and melting point is 157.36. </p>
                 <h2> Who? where? when was it discoverd? </h2>
                  <p><strong>Krypton</strong> is one of the three found in <em>noble</em> gases found in London. William Ramsey a scottish scientist and Moris Travers a english chemist found <strong>Krypton</strong> in london May 39th 1898, which was actually the 3rd noble gas that William Ramsay found after helium and argon. they actally discovered krypton by accident when they were studying about liquefied air. Later on sir William Ramasy won a noble prize in chemistry for finding many noble gases including Krypton.

                 <p> What was the money called on Superman's home planet?</p>

                 <h2> Common use of Krypton</h2>
                  <p> Commercially <strong>Krypton</strong> is utilised as a filler gas for energy-saving fluorescent lighting. It's also found in some high-speed photography flash bulbs. It is more reactive than the lighter gases in its group, allowing it to form chemical compounds.

                  <h2>  A bizzare fact<h2>
                  <p> A bizarre fact is <strong>Krypton</strong> is one of the <em>rarest</em> gases on the planet, accounting for only 1 part per million by volume of the atmosphere.</p>
